# My LLM Engineering Learning Journey

This repository captures my personal learning journey through **Ed Donner’s LLM Engineering course** on Udemy.  
It documents my hands-on experience with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, covering their architecture, training, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and practical applications.

Through this repository, I aim to track my progress, consolidate my understanding, and showcase projects and experiments built while learning LLM engineering.
